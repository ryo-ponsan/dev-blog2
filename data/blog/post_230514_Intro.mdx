# 0.How to use OpenAI API on Python

## Load API key

```
import openai
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

openai.api_key  = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

# Prompting Principles

# 1. Guidelines

1. write clear and specific instructions
2. give the model time to "think"

<a id="1"></a>

## **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input

- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`

````
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
````

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output

- JSON, HTML
- python can read as dictionary type

```
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \
with their authors and genres.
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys:
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

```
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes.
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

```
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \
valley flows from a modest spring; the \
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

## **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

````
# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions:
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)
````

#### Ask for output in a specified format

```
prompt_2 = f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions:
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by
  <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the
  following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Use the following format:
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in Italian summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion

Not good example. ChatGPT's **weak point**

```
prompt = f"""
Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials.
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Note that the student's solution is actually not correct.

#### We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first.

Good example

```
prompt = f"""
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem.
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:
```

question here

```
Student's solution:
```

student's solution here

```
Actual solution:
```

steps to work out the solution and your solution here

```
Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
just calculated:
```

yes or no

```
Student grade:
```

correct or incorrect

```

working out the financials.

- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \
  me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \

3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
   Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000

```
Actual solution:
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

And one additional tactic to reduce hallucinations in
the case that you want the model to kind of generate answers
based on a text is to ask the model to first find
any relevant quotes from the text and then
ask it to use those quotes to kind of answer questions and
kind of having a way to trace the answer back to the
source document is often pretty helpful to kind
of reduce these hallucinations.

## Model Limitations: Hallucinations

- Boie is a real company, the product name is not real.

```
prompt = f"""
Tell me about AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Reducing hallucinations: **First find relevant information, then answer the question based on the relevant information
